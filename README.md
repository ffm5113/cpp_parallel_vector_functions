# cpp_parallel_vector_functions
The Parallel Vector Functions Program (C++) uses two parallel vectors, which are each filled with 500 random numbers between 1 and 100. The vectors are passed to a function that returns an integer indicating how many times both vectors contained even numbers in the same location.
